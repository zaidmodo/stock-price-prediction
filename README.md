# stock-price-prediction
Description:
This project aims to predict stock prices in real-time using Python by combining financial data streaming, data preprocessing, and machine learning techniques. It uses APIs (such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or IEX Cloud) to fetch live stock data, including open, close, high, low prices, and volume.

The collected data is cleaned and transformed into suitable input for a prediction model â€” typically an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network due to its strength in handling time-series data. The model is trained on historical stock data and updated periodically for accuracy. The application features a user interface or dashboard (built using libraries like Streamlit, Dash, or Tkinter) that displays live charts and predicted stock trends.

Key features include:

Real-time data fetching and display.

Historical data analysis.

Stock price prediction using LSTM or regression models.

Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices.

Optional portfolio simulation or decision support tools.

Technologies Used:
Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Plotly

APIs: Yahoo Finance (via yfinance), Alpha Vantage, or other real-time sources

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, or Streamlit

Machine Learning: LSTM, Linear Regression, ARIMA (optional)
